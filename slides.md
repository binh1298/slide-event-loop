# Agenda

- 1. **Single threaded languages vs Multi threaded languages**
- 2. **What's a stack**
- 3. **What's a queue**
- 4. **How Javascript execute your code**
- 5. **Let's zoom out**
- 6. **The event loop**

# Multi threaded languages

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

Languages such as **C#**, **Java** are **multi-threaded languages**.
This mean they can execute **multiple things** at a time

<br/>

> Imagine eating with 2 hands. It means you can **eat multiple things at a time**. <br/> However, it **doesn't necessary mean that you can eat faster than with only one**.

# Single threaded language

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

**Javascript** is a **single-threaded language**.
This means it can only execute **one thing** at a time! 

<br/>

> Imagine if you only have one hand. You **can only eat one thing at a time**.

<br/>

ðŸ¤” How can Javascript executes asynchronous code? 

-> Answer: It uses the **event loop**

#### In order to understand what **event loop** is, we have to understand 2 concepts: **Stack** & **Queue**

---

# Stack

---

# Stack

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

**Stack** is a linear data structure that items can only be added or removed in 2 ways:

- push: Add to the top
- pop: Remove from the top

<br/>

> Imagine a stack of dishes (or just look at the image here)

<br/>

ðŸ¤” What does this have to do with JS code execution?

-> Answer: I'm glad you asked

# The Call Stack

# The Call Stack

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

Let's take a look at this piece of code, assuming this entire piece is wrapped by a *main* function: 

```ts {all|all|14|9-12|10|5-7|6|11|1-3|2|11|14|15|all}
function eat(cookedFood: string) {
  console.log("Chomp chomp", cookedFood);
}

function makeFood(food: string) {
  return `Cooked ${food}`
}

function haveDinner(food: string) {
  const cookedFood = makeFood(food);  
  eat(cookedFood);
}

haveDinner("Fried Eggs");
console.log("Rest and watch TV");
```
