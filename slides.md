# Agenda

- 1. **Single threaded languages vs Multi threaded languages**
- 2. **Stack and Queue**
- 3. **How Javascript execute your code using only stack**
- 4. **Let's zoom out**

---

# Multi threaded languages

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

Languages such as **C#**, **Java** are **multi-threaded languages**.
This mean they can execute **multiple things** at a time

<br/>

> Imagine eating with 2 hands. It means you can **eat multiple things at a time**. <br/> However, it **doesn't necessary mean that you can eat faster than with only one**.

</div>

# Single threaded language

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

**Javascript** is a **single-threaded language**.
This means it can only execute **one thing** at a time! 

<br/>

> Imagine if you only have one hand. You **can only eat one thing at a time**.

<br/>

ðŸ¤” How can Javascript executes asynchronous code? 

-> Answer: It uses the **event loop**

</div>
</div>

<br/>
<br/>

#### In order to understand what **event loop** is, we have to understand 2 concepts: **Stack** & **Queue**

---

# Stack

---

# Stack

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

**Stack** is an "array" of items can only be added or removed in 2 ways:

- push: Add to the top
- pop: Remove from the top

<br/>

> Imagine a stack of dishes (or just look at the image here)

<br/>

ðŸ¤” What does this have to do with JS code execution?

-> Answer: I'm glad you asked, but let's wait a bit to talk about the Queue first

# Queue

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

**Queue** is an "array" of items can only be added or removed in 2 ways:

- push: Add to the bottom
- pop: Remove from the top

<br/>

> Imagine going to the supermarket during covid

<br/>

ðŸ¤” What does this have to do with JS code execution?

-> Answer: First, let's take a look at how your code is executed using **only the Stack**

# The Call Stack

---

# The Call Stack

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

Let's take a look at this piece of code, assuming this entire piece is wrapped by a *main* function: 

```ts {all|all|14|9-12|10|5-7|6|11|1-3|2|11|14|15|all}
function transform(data) {
  return `Transformed data: ${data}`
}

function getFromService(data) {
  return `Data from service ${data}`
}

function fetchData(data) {
  const dataFromService = getFromService(data);  
  return transform(dataFromService);
}

const data = fetchData("Books");
console.log("Render data:", data);
```

</div>
<div>

<CallStackCarousel />

</div>
</div>

# The problem with the Call Stack

##### ðŸ¤” What if it takes a really long time to getFromService()? ðŸ¤”

```ts {all}
function getFromService(data) {
  const start = new Date().getTime();
  while (new Date().getTime() < start + 10000);
  return `Data from service: ${data}`;
}

function fetchData(data) {
  const dataFromService = getFromService();
  return `Test ${dataFromService}`
}

const data = fetchData("Books");
console.log(data);
```
-> Answer: we actually need 3 things:
- The browser's help (or Node/Deno): provides fetch/setTimeout
- The queue & event loop
- The callback pattern

```ts {all}
function fetchData(data, callback) {
  setTimeout(
    () => {callback(`Fetched ${data}`)}, 
    3000
  )
}

fetchData("Books", (data) => console.log(data));
fetchData("Students", (data) => console.log(data));
